Trident is a fully supported open source project maintained by [NetApp](https://www.netapp.com). It has been designed from the ground up to help you meet your containerized applications' persistence demands using industry-standard interfaces, such as the [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/introduction.html).

Trident deploys in Kubernetes clusters as pods and provides dynamic storage orchestration services for your Kubernetes workloads. It enables your containerized applications to quickly and easily consume persistent storage from NetApp’s broad portfolio that includes [ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/ontap.aspx) (AFF/FAS/Select/Cloud), [Element](https://www.netapp.com/data-management/element-software?utm_source=NetAppTrident_ReadTheDocs&utm_campaign=Trident) (HCI/SolidFire), and [SANtricity](https://www.netapp.com/data-management/santricity?utm_source=NetAppTrident_ReadTheDocs&utm_campaign=Trident) (E/EF-Series) data management software, as well as the [Azure NetApp Files](https://cloud.netapp.com/azure-netapp-files?utm_source=NetAppTrident_ReadTheDocs&utm_campaign=Trident) service, [Cloud Volumes Service on Google Cloud](https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-gcp?utm_source=NetAppTrident_ReadTheDocs&utm_campaign=Trident), and the [Cloud Volumes Service on AWS](https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-aws?utm_source=NetAppTrident_ReadTheDocs&utm_campaign=Trident).

Trident is also a foundational technology for NetApp's [Astra](http://cloud.netapp.com/Astra?utm_source=NetAppTrident_ReadTheDocs&utm_campaign=Trident), which addresses your data protection, disaster recovery, portability, and migration use cases for Kubernetes workloads leveraging NetApp's industry-leading data management technology for snapshots, backups, replication, and cloning.
